1. Solve the differential equation
\[ x + y \frac{dy}{dx} = 0 \]
\emph{Answer}:
Separating the variables
\[ y \frac{dy}{dx} = -x \]
\[ ydy = -xdx \]
Integrating both sides, we obtain:
\[ \int y\,dy = \int -x\,dx \]
\[ \frac{y^2}{2} = -\frac{x^2}{2} + C_1 \]
\[ y^2 = -x^2 + 2 * C_1 \]
Thus, the solution is

$x^2 + y^2 = C$ \\

where $C = 2 * C_1$.

2. Generate a family of curves for the above equation and find a particular solution for $y(0) = 10$.
\\
\emph{Answer}:
The family of curves is a set of circles with centre at the origin.\\
\newpage
%This is a very simple method of including an image (via TeX commands in circles.tex)
% \input was used instead of \include since the latter inroduces a page break
% which is not desirable.
%\input{circles}
% Using EPS is the better alternative. However, using it places the plot on a later page
% which is not acceptable

\textbf{Particular Solution}:
Substituting the given values y=10 when x=0, in $x^2+y^2=C$,
\[ 100 + 0 = C\]
\[C = 100\]
Hence, the particular solution is:
{\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
\begin{tabular}{|c|}
\hline
$x^2 + y^2 = 100$\\
\hline
\end{tabular}}\\

3. The number of bacteria \emph{N} is 10,000 at time \emph{t}=0. At \emph{t}=3 hours, \emph{N}=500,000. Find the value of
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)]\emph{N} at \emph{t}=24 hours
\\
\item[(ii)]\emph{t} when \emph{N} is 20,000
\end{enumerate}
\emph{Answer}:
From theory, we know that the rate of change of the number of bacteria at a given time is proportional to the number of bacteria present at the time.
Thus,
\[ \frac{dN}{dt} = kN\]
Separating variables, we obtain:
\[ \frac{dN}{N} = kdt \]
Integrating, we obtain:
\[ lnN = kt + C_1\]
Simplifying,
\[N=k_1 e^{kt}\]
At time t=0, we have N=10000. Hence,
\[k_1 = 10000\]
Thus,
\[N=10000e^{kt}\]
At time t=3, we have N=500000,
Thus,
\[500000 = 10000 e^{k*3}\]
Thus,
\[k=\frac{1}{3}* ln50\]
\[k=1.304\]
\[N=100000e^{1.304t}\]

For (i),
\[N=10000*e^{1.304*24}\]
\begin{center}
{\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
\begin{tabular}{|c|}
\hline
N=390553114652259072.000000\\
\hline
\end{tabular}}
\end{center}

For (ii), N=20000
\[20000 = 10000 * e^{1.304*t}\]
\[1.304*t = ln2\]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|}

t=0.903864 hours\\

3. $C_{14}$ isotope has a half-life of 5600 hours. What is the fraction that remains after 10,000 years?
\\
\emph{Answer}:
The mass of $C_{14}$ remaining after time \emph{t} can be modelled by the equation:
\[M=M_0e^{-kt}\]
where $M_0$ is the mass at time \emph{t}=0 and \emph{k} is a constant.
We are given data that the mass at \emph{t}=5600 years is half of the mass present initially.
Hence,
\[\frac{M_0}{2} = M_0e^{-5600k}\]
\[k=\frac{ln2}{5600}\]
\[k=0.000124\]
Thus,
\[M=M_0e^{-0.000124t}\]
At t=10000 years,
\[M=M_0e^{-1.24}\]
\[M=M_0*0.289384\]
Thus, the fraction remaining after 10000 years is \underline{0.289384}.
